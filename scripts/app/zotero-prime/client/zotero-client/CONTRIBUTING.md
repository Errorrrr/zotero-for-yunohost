## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Zotero does not use GitHub Issues for bug reports or feature requests. Please post all such requests to the [Zotero Forums](https://forums.zotero.org), where Zotero developers and many others can help. Keeping product discussions in the Zotero Forums allows the entire Zotero community to participate, including domain experts that can address many questions better than Zotero developers.

For confirmed bugs or agreed-upon changes, Zotero developers will create new issues in the relevant repositories.
